## Red-Black Tree
### Property
> In addition to the requirements imposed on a binary search tree
the following must be satisfied by a redâ€“black tree:

- each node is either red or black.
- the root is black. This rule is sometimes omitted.
- all leaves (_`NIL`_) are black.
- if a node is red, then both its children are black.
- every path from a given node to any of its descendant _`NIL`_ nodes contains the same number of black nodes.
