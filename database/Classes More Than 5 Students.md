<https://leetcode.com/problems/classes-more-than-5-students/>

### Schema
```sql
Create table If Not Exists courses (student varchar(255), class varchar(255));
Truncate table courses;
insert into courses (student, class) values ('A', 'Math');
insert into courses (student, class) values ('B', 'English');
insert into courses (student, class) values ('C', 'Math');
insert into courses (student, class) values ('D', 'Biology');
insert into courses (student, class) values ('E', 'Math');
insert into courses (student, class) values ('F', 'Computer');
insert into courses (student, class) values ('G', 'Math');
insert into courses (student, class) values ('H', 'Math');
insert into courses (student, class) values ('I', 'Math');
```

There is a table courses with columns: student and class

Please list out all classes which have more than or equal to 5 students.

For example, the table:

```
+---------+------------+
| student | class      |
+---------+------------+
| A       | Math       |
| B       | English    |
| C       | Math       |
| D       | Biology    |
| E       | Math       |
| F       | Computer   |
| G       | Math       |
| H       | Math       |
| I       | Math       |
+---------+------------+
```

Should output:

```
+---------+
| class   |
+---------+
| Math    |
+---------+
```

Note:
The students should **not be counted duplicate** in each course.

### SQL
Note: We use `distinct` here since the student name may duplicated in a class as it is mentioned int he problem description.

```sql
select class from courses
group by class
having count(distinct student) >= 5;
```
