## Top K Frequent Elements
### Illustrate
<https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements>

Given a non-empty array of integers, return the **k** most frequent elements.

Note:

- You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ number of unique elements.
- Your algorithm's time complexity must be better than O(n log n), where n is the array's size.

### Example
```c
Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2
Output: [1,2]

Input: nums = [1], k = 1
Output: [1]
```

### Code
```c
